# Imaging Media and Drives
#### Forensinc images match exactly the original source drive, volume, partition, or device. including Slack space and unallocated space.
#### Slack space is the space left when a file is written.
#### Unallocated space is space that has not been partitioned.

## Analysis Utilities
- Timelines of systems changes
- Validation tools that check known good version of files against those found on a system.
- File analysis capabilities that can look at filesystem metadata (MASTER FILE TABLE FOR NTFS) to identify changes, access and deletions.
- Windows Registry analysis
- Log file parsing and review

### Live memory capture analysis
#### Memory dump analysis is use when recovering decryption keys for full disk encryption products like Bitlocker
#### Hibernation files and crash dumps can both contain the data needed to decrypt the drive

# The Forensic Process
1. Determine what are you trying to find out
2. Outline the location and types of data that would help you answer step 1
3. Document and review your plan.
4. Acquire and preserve evidence
5. Perform initial analysis.
6. Use initial analysis to guide further work.
7. Report on the findings of the investigation.
