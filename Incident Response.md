![incidenr-chart](https://phoenixts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/incidentresponse.png)

## PREPARATION

### NIST RECOMEMNDED INCIDENT RESPONSE TOOLKIT
- Digital Forensic Workstations
- Backup Devices
- Spare Server and networking equipment
- Forensic and packet capture software
- Laptops for data collection, analysis and reporting
- Bootable USB media containing trusted copies of forensic tools

## DETECTION AND ANALYSIS

### NIST FOUR MAJOR SECURITY EVENTS INDICATORS

- Alerts
- Logs
- Publicly Available information
- People

### NIST ACTIONS TO EFFECTIVE INCIDENT RESPONSE

- Profile network & systems to measure the characteristics of expected activity
- Understand normal behavior of users, systems, networks, and applications
- Create a loggin policy that specifies the information  that must be logged by systems, applications, and network devices
- Perform event correlation to combine information from multiple sources.
- Synchronize clocks accross servers, workstations, and network devices.
- Capture netowork traffic as soon as an incident is suspected
- Filter information to reduce clutter
- Seek assistence from external resources

# CONTAINMENT, ERADICATION, AND RECOVERY
1. Select a containment strategy appropiate  to the incident circumstances.
2. Implement the selected containment strategy, as needed to limit the damage caused by the incident.
3. Gather additional evidence, as needed to support the response effort and potential legal action.
4. Identify the attackers and attacking systems.
5. Eradicate the effects of the incident and recover normal business operations.

# POST INCIDENT ACTIVITY
## NIST lessons-learned processes:
- Exactly what happened and at what times?
- How well did staff and management  perform  in responding to the incident
- Were the documented procedures followed? Where they adequated?
- What information was needed sooner?
- Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the recovery?
- What addional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyze, and mitigate future incidents?
